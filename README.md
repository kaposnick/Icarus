# Nikolaos Apostolakis Thesis
===================================

This repo stores all the files for my thesis. I have decided to put
this work-in-progress in the public domain both to generate interest and
to get feedback. Thus, feedback is assuredly welcome, and feel free to post
Issues.

To build, make sure you have maven install.
